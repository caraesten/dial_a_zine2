# dial_a_zine2
The new-and-improved kotlin version of the CMS running [New Session](https://anewsession.com).

It's the replacement for the Python-based [Dial-A-Zine](https://github.com/caraesten/dial_a_zine),
which I intend to keep around for HTML generation, at least for a little longer.

The structure of the issues are identical to the old dial-a-zine, except they're included in the
resources directory to be packaged up in a jar for easier deployment (see the [example issue](https://github.com/caraesten/dial_a_zine2/tree/main/src/main/resources/example_issue)).
