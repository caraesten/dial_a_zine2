1.
There's a windmill placed across the road from the Chevron on the way to
 Carlsbad.
It is tulip headed, mosquelike, and gray-blue.
Its four flat arms turn steadily in the clear, absent air
Above the line of cars, heavy with fresh gas, waiting to get back into the
 freeway.

Squared-off and round-bodied vehicles barter for lane space headed in five, six
 directions
About a mile inland from the ocean,
Which sparkles violence
and frustrates the shortboarders with its summerlong smallness.

The keycutter on the corner tells us to come back Thursday for the fobs.
Parked cars shake and sink: drivers get out or back inside
Before and after errands in the strip mall.
The locksmith here is cheap and likes a challenge.
His two long arms confabulate and snake along the counter where he works.
