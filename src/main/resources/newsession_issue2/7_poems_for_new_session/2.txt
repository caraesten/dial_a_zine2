2.
And what if, after the laundry, love is finished
Like a party, and everyone goes home?
But somebody always stays, at least the giver of the feast, who lives there,
And the next day they clean a little bit and make the coffee
For the stragglers who had hidden themselves in deeper rooms to fall asleep.

Hosting wouldn't preclude washing their party clothes as well,
Now that it's the next day and some of us are still here
Detangling hair with dim fingers and looking outside at chaparral.
The sunset had been red and blue clouds over the pink and tan hills.

The delusional spread of the syrup of caffeine over the crepe of collective
 hangover took slow and sweet effect.
The blackened sunshine dropped across moths flat against the scrub brush
 While inside, cross-stitches of green-fuchsia poppies scale the walls like
  free climbers.

Some people, this suggests, do not "go home" in the traditional way.
And some people are already home and happy to host you there.
