4. After the Perseids

This morning we ripped along
Del Dios highway back towards the coast
between the folds of hills on either side.

The creases of the mountains are so similar to skin. . .

Would that we could hide beneath
 the thick cream folds of hillside
That form the low banks of Lake Hodges

Shaken out over eons of sun and eons of night

Under the mountains are caves shaped in wide spirals
Somewhat like the water patterns shaped by reefs.
The lizards on oceanside cliffs scandalize the sun.

The surface of the water is so similar to skin. . .

Sand billows in swirls of cloud beneath the rising curls and reorganizing
 backwash.
