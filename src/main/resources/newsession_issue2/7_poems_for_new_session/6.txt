5. In the air tonight

That song that we heard at the venue inside the European city park
Leaning on our bikes plays
Thru the speakers in the bathroom of this fast-paced coffee chain back home

The recording is remastered from the 80s
While the singer was on one of those last-hurrah overseas tours when we heard
 him
Live, he sounded just like the old recording

We three leaned together in the green dark behind the metal barricades around
 the venue
Anticipating the parts that we knew
the drums and the drop

Our three skins like a singular stretched organ
Over the ring of the head of a real tonga
Recovering from a day spent curing in brutal sun
Vienna breezes cooling our thousands of love-pocked pores
