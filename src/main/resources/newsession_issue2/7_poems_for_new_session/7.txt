6. JOSHUA TREE
The presence of clouds brings the felt temperature down by twenty degrees.
The sun flaunts between the swaths of cover

The sale nail polish at the grocery store
In the combo beauty and health aisle
Is purple-blue-green, like the wings of desert wasps.

Or like the five-foot feathers of peacocks
Or any other natural pearlesence.
Sunlight, moonlight, marl of Milky Way. . .

Oh, don't turn in already, the stars are still out!
The influencer vampires want you to see their ass shots,
their acai ice cream,
their Ayahuasca uddiyana bandhas.

PRAYER CHANGES THINGS, reads highway markers
Encircled by a pattern of American flags.

"In that sense, environmentally,
I get why the metropolitan Europeans are all atheists
While everyone out here thinks they're divinely chosen
To be God's pool boy or whatever," as Felix said.
