is pebbled like Lake Michigan, and the burble
pulls long rows of rocks back with rainstick sound
or crisp crinkle of chiropractic grind:

calcium deposits accumulating tension
in the thousands-of-miles-long neck and shoulders
(coast and hills) of California, every day

wrung out, and redeposited...
We crinkle, try to lie flatter, sit up taller.
The natural curves of the spine of the state erode

(also naturally) and the nerves animating
the body are blanched by wildfire.
It is August first
