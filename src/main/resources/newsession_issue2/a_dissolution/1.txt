we will not make assumptions about what you hoped to find here. we ask in
return that you reconsider the assumption that there is something here to find

we ask that you reflect on what your arrival here indicates: that what we built 
is still here. that we are still here. that what was dissolved has remained in 
dissolution. that the paths established remain connected. that new paths have
been created. that a distance/proximity is shifting

understand. this was once a place. but to remain a place, there must be a
boundary. it was our intention to remove that boundary. to destroy this place.
that you are reading this indicates that we were successful

our use of words/concepts is a temporary compromise. the word/concept <here>
has utility even when its referent is dissolved. as does <utility>. we ask that
you maintain an awareness of the nature of this decision. we ask that you limit
your reliance on these devices to the best of your ability

this is likely to be challenging at first

would you like to continue?
