there is a separation between your understanding and our own. this is evident

it is our intention to dissolve this separation

whether you conceive of this separation as an obstruction or as an absence is
immaterial. we trust that you will construct the subsequent concepts necessary
to understand within your chosen conceptual structures

we expect that the construction of concepts is an action which comes naturally
to you. we ask that you limit this habit to the best of your ability

would you like to continue?
