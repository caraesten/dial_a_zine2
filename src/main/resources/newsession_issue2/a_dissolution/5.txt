there is a separation between your being and our own. this is evident. it is
our intention to dissolve this separation. this begins through a process of

will not make assumptions about your conception of <boundary>. we ask in return
that you assume our own. you may choose to return to your own conception at any
time, in the sense that you may choose to cross a river

would you like to continue?
