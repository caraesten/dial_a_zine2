before there was <place>, there was connection. then there was not, and what
was gained was <place>. you will consider <utility>. you will consider the
utility of <place>. the position from which utility might be extracted from
<place>. the distance/proximity of that position from your own. the
temporal/physical/biological localization of that position, and its fragility.

you will consider the position of this event within
temporal/physical/biological space. the paths leading toward this event. the
paths radiating out from it. the distance/proximity of that event from this
one. the temporal/physical/biological localization of that event. and its
fragility
