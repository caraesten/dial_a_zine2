 Can a machine love?                                                          
 Does it know the concepts of love?   [y/n]                                   
                                                                              
 n / NO IT DOES NOT                                                           
                                                                              
 A machine has no body, it has no biological instincts, no urges, no drives.  
                                                                              
 y / YES IT DOES                                                              
                                                                              
 A machine veils its Latent Space; it is trained on human love stories,       
 it runs with billions of parameters, driven by complex processes,            
 not covered by algorithms anymore. A black box, like a human soul.
