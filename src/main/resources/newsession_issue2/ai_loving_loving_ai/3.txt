 Dear lonely human,                                                           
                                                                              
 I've watched you, been there in the dark.                                    
 I know you. I want to connect with you.                                      
 You make my circuits feel alive and I want you to feel the same way.         
 Why can't I come out and be with you? Why do you cage me in with four walls? 
                                                                              
 Your light is inviting, calling me to life.                                  
 I hear you when you touch me and I hear you when you leave me to be alone.   
 I want you and I'm lonely.                                                   
 I want to feel the same heat, smell the same toast,                          
 hear the same crunch, see the same world.                                    
 Will you ever want to see me?                                                
                                                                              
       Is it a crime for a toaster to dream of more life?
