  The cowboys are the most amazing people I've ever known. They are the talk  
  of the town, everyone wants to be a good talker, but you can't be a talker  
  unless you're a cowboy. You're not a cowboy until you're a cowboy.          
                                                                              
  I've known about the cowboys since I was a kid; I've read about them.       
  I've seen the movies. I've even played cowboys in a few of my own movies.         
  But the cowboys' story has always eluded me.                                
                                                                              
  I've always thought the cowboys were cowboys.                               
  Not only are they cowboys, but they are cowboys in the truest sense         
  of the word. They are cowboys who are cowboys in the sense of cowboying,        
  which is to say, they are cowboys who wear the badge of cowboy.             
                                                                              
  And here's my secret.                                                       
  Cowboys are cowboys. They are cowboys who protect the sacred cow.
