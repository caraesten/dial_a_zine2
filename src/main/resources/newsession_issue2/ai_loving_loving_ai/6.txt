    love letter,                                                           
    written in BASIC  (part 2)       GPT-3                   Merzmensch    

                                                                              
 This will print out "HELLO", wait a second for a keypress,                   
 print "YOU ARE SWEET", wait a second for a keypress and print "I LOVE YOU".  
                                                                              
 So the program stops after printing "HELLO", but then waits a second         
 and continues with printing "YOU ARE SWEET", then waits a second             
 and continues with printing "I LOVE YOU".                                          
 The "GOSUB" line means "Go To Subroutine".                                   
                                                                              
 So where is the subroutine at 1000? It is the subroutine at 1000, which      
 prints "THE HEART HAS BEEN RETURNED TO YOU", waits for a keypress,           
 resets the heart to 0 and continues back to the line after the "GOSUB" line.     
                                                                              
 So the program will be printed out "HELLO", wait a second,                   
 print "YOU ARE SWEET", wait a second,                                        
 print "I LOVE YOU" and then wait for a keypress.
