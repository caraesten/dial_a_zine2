yeah i've been uploaded for like five years or so. it's pretty sweet. just
chilling, looking at websites, gaming. not sleeping

i dunno, i just was kind of fed up with having to support myself all the time,
you know? so i just decided to just retire to the internet. it's a flat fee!

yeah like
working sucked, and then what did i have to do with my time? give my money to
some fucking landlord? drive around and fill the sky with smog?  Idk

Exactly, it didn't really feel possible to do anything without hurting SOMEone.

with friends in whatever time zones
