ok basically so these big tech companies have all this data to store, right? and
they have users all over the world? and they want the data to get to you fast
(since you're in a physical location haha). so they have data centers all over
the world so that when you request some data it comes from the closest one to
you so that there's as little travel time as possible
but they dont want to have a million copies of all the data, so they shard it
this means that they only put the data in the places they think it's likely to
be accessed from
so like, theres probably a data center an hour drive from you that has you and
all your friends' social media data or whatever

yeah so the company i'm uploaded with, they shard their data, and uh
the shard with my memories of my family hasn't been online for a few days
