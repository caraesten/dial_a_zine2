I guess I miss food in general. Not that much because like I can virtually
stimilate my taste buds as much as I want but I definitely miss the ritual.
Sometimes gaming with people you don't get a chance to really just TALK, you

no they don't officially call it virtual taste bud stimulation i just like
calling things what they are sometimes
