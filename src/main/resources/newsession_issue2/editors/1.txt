I was recently reminded of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, a collection of papyrus
fragments dating back to the third century BCE, discovered over a hundred years
ago in an ancient rubbish heap in Egypt. This accidental archive contains verses
of Sappho, receipts and horoscopes, epistolary gossip and legal feuds, magic
spells, and missing pieces of Latin literature.

I’ve always loved incidental collections, the contingency of medium, so much so
that I, like many writers in this collection, strive to make artful and
deliberate a brilliant encounter. From a story unfolding over chat to poems
written by and with AI to an AI protagonist sending IMs from beyond the grave to
texts composed on typewriter re-inscribed via telnet to love stories written
across time and internet ether, there’s something chatty here, crackling.
Writing that’s not just an abstraction, but something you can find and reach
for, like another person.

We hope you enjoy this curation, and celebrate our writers, with us.
