Taken together, my history and the history of telephone repair service
bureaus as a concept are in part a history of struggle against the
spectre of Frederick Taylor that haunts the contemporary office, a
struggle that ultimately ends in retreat or surrender. After long enough
on the phone, I chose the latter, and left the call queue to develop
system automations.
[I had other reasons for getting off the phone, more personal ones. At the
time it presented as an anxiety that I could not name, but would come to
understand is gender dysphoria I could not call myself the name I needed
in order to give off the authoritative air of the tester of bygone days,
and I couldn't muster the feminine charm of Pat Fleet - *the* Operator -
or Jane Barbe, the legendary Time Lady. I had entered the phone
company as a gentleman scholar, and after three years realized that I
had become - been transformed into? -  a Telephone Girl.]
