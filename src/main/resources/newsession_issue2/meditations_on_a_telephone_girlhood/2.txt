*Meditation 1: On Letters Alone*

An Illinois Bell training manual from 1931, targeted to those who would
now be called "outbound sales representatives" contains the following
comparison between the postal letter and the telephone "message":[^1]
"Real friendships are too rare and valuable to be broken when you or
your friends move out of town. Correspondence will help for a time, but
friendships do not flourish on letters alone."[^2] At a moment in global
history during which we are all, in essence, friends from out of town to
one another, called to keep our distance, to accept absence both
temporary and final, it can sting to hear that friendship \-- to say
nothing of romance, or familial ties \-- is vulnerable when paired with
distance. The Bell ad almost "feels correct" for our own moment, in that
the latency of the post creates room for unfamiliarity where the (then
very profitable) long distance telephone call does not.
