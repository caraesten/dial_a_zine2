These facilities of immediate contact, however, were built on the same
copper substrate that our telephone man was selling ninety years ago. It is
these wires beneath and above the ground that we have excitedly and fearfully
metaphorized as a spider web or the reaching tentacles of Leviathan, a metaphor
we retain in the age of the "world wide web," and have, like the telephone
sceptics of the early 20th century, extended to late capitalism[^3]. 
The postal service,is a no less essential but far more
deliberate, more immediately material and patient means of interaction.
Friendship in our moment, it seems, can survive off of the absence of
slow epistolary communication for longer than it can survive without the
nervous electric pulse of telecommunication.
["On letters alone," I read, and immediately think of you - you and
them, you and I - and I contend with the reality of your limited
epistolary oxygen, and my chest tightens as though the cabin has
depressurized and I find myself, paradoxically, rushing to adjust their
mask, both before putting on my own, and before you can get to that task
yourself.]
