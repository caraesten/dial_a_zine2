*Meditation 2: A Biographical Sketch of Telephone Girlhood*

Before we continue, I would like to let you know, that even after
years away from the call center, it is *painfully* difficult not to
complete that sentence with "that a minimum trouble isolation charge of
$85 *may* apply *if* the technician finds the trouble outside our
network," a sentence indelibly etched into my soul, almost worthy of
being my epitaph.I come to telephony by way of an undergraduate degree 
in English and a failure to find a suitable graduate program 
(can one call it a failure if one did not actually try?), and out of the 
motivation, like so many before me, to neither starve nor languish in 
the elements. I entered in 2016 as what the Bell Operating Companies 
(and, by extension, the company I joined) call a "repair service attendant" 
a title that, through the gradual erosion of the differentiation of labor,
applies to those employed in a number of different tasks related to the
collection, tracking and resolution of telephone (or Internet)
subscribers' trouble reports. In its most basic form, it is a call center 
job: answer phone, ask questions, offer troubleshooting advice, 
and if all else fails, take a ticket.
