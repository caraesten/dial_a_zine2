Like many entry-level customer facing jobs in telephony, historically,
an RSA was a woman - usually young, usually unwed, one of the vast
cohort of "telephone girls" who served as the faces, but more often the
voices, of the Bell System. A film produced by AT&T in 1953, entitled
"Telephone Repair Service," dramatizes the early early decades of
telephone trouble management.[^5] It is of interest both in its
depiction of the expected career of the "telephone girl" (including
marriage to one's male supervisor) and in its illustration of the
typical division of labor in the early decades of the repair service
bureau. The phone rings, is answered by a young woman who promptly and
pleasantly answers questions, inquires further, and delicately inscribes
on a slip of paper the nature and location of the trouble. This ticket is 
then handed to a tester, a man, a skilled craftsperson who, using the test 
desk, can measure the electrical characteristics of the line, simulate various
conditions, and determine whether an outside craftsperson - a "lineman"
- should be dispatched. Through the mid-seventies, at an ever-increasing
scale and with a gradual easing of gender divisions in the labor pool,
the work of the RSA continued as a purely analog affair. The continued
rapid growth of the telephone network, however, created a need for a
level of efficiency that paper record keeping could not reach. Enter the
computer. Enter LMOS.
