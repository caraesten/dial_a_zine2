The Loop Maintenance Operations System is more than a computerized
version of the ticket pad used by our dramatized telephone girl - it
*is* this, but also a line record database[^6], a replacement for the
tester's test desk apparatus[^7], efficiency reporting tool[^8], and as
a unified system represented an early ancestor of today's customer
records management software. In development since the mid-1970s (and
replacing an earlier attempt called MLR, or "mechanized line record"),
LMOS would achieve 75% adoption within the Bell System by the
publication of Volume 61, Issue 6 of the Bell System Technical
Journal[^9]. Its rapid emergence led to "significant reductions in
repair expenses" and "flexibility" in how repair service bureaus (and
their accompanying workers) could be organized, ultimately leading to
the emergence and proliferation of the Centralized Repair Service
Attendant Bureau, or CRSAB.
