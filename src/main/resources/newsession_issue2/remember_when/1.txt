The nature of regret is not that the present is contingent on the past, but that
the past is always contingent on the present.

The final notes of the organ floated into the air, and the newly-married couple 
arranged themselves on the front steps of the church to receive their well-
wishes from the throng of attendees. We lingered at the back of the crowd. Just 
before we reached the door, I tugged on my companion's arm, pulling her off to 
the corner of the narthex.

"What are you doing?" she whispered, casting a glance towards the river of 
people passing us by while I fiddled with a lock on the door. We were partially 
obscured by a YOU ARE WELCOMED! sign that had been sidelined for the wedding.

"We have one more day here - is that really how you want to spend it?" The next 
morning, I would be flying off to settle in Seattle, while she was heading south
to start a new job. The lock clicked satisfyingly and I pulled the door open.

"Besides, we hardly know these people." Her eyes flicked to me, again to the 
crowd outside, and then back to me once more.

"Okay dude," she said, as I gestured for her to go through, then followed her, 
with a quick glance around me to ensure no one's eyes were on us before I pulled
the door shut behind us. Dustmotes danced in the air, hung there long ago, 
vibrating from the unceasing buzz of the cicada swarm outside.
