We exited on an upper balcony overlooking the nave. It was well-maintained, if
cluttered; it probably hadn't been used as a public area of the church in years.
Music stands lined the western wall, with stacks of hymnals, four feet tall, 
teetering at its ends. The pews had been unbolted from the floor and parted, 
towards either side of the building, leaving the floor in the center bare. The 
air was still sticky and humid. The midday heat was only beginning to break.

She threw her cardigan into a pew and plopped herself down on the dusty floor, 
taking care to arrange her dress around her. I tossed my suit jacket over the 
back of the same pew and leaned over the railing, my ankles crossed. Not another
soul was left in the nave. Empty spaces had always called to me, in a way both 
peaceful and terrifying. It was as if they saw in me a kindred spirit, beckoning
me to lose myself to them. As if embracing the emptiness would make all my 
problems go away.

Behind me, she had begun tracing lines in the dust. Two stick figures side-by-
side, but not touching. Then, underneath, "M&M." I turned around to see her 
pause for a second, before adding a third line. "1996-2013."

"Maybe we'll meet again at the next cicada wedding," I quipped.
