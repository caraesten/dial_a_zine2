It was seventeen years ago that we had met at another wedding. It was a day just
like that one, the early summer heat and relentless trill setting us on edge 
since we had arrived early that morning. We were the only kids our age present, 
and both assigned flower children as our roles. Our only relief from the boredom
and discomfort was each other. We competed to see who could throw the petals the
farthest (she won, of course) and then made faces at each other throughout the 
ceremony, our short legs kicking back and forth.

When our parents had finally had enough of our antics, we fled downstairs into 
the basement to play hide-and-seek in the dark. Neither of us could find the 
light switch, and the only available light came spilling out of the seams around
the entry way. We emerged that day bruised and battered, from our collisions 
with the furniture and with each other, but grinning from ear to ear, and 
announced to anyone who would listen our intention to be best friends forever.

"I don't think cicadas mate for life, dummy." She lied down on the cool floor, 
making angels in the dust, her forearm wiping away her inscription as if it had 
never existed.

"Don't they?" I joined her and nestled into the crook of her arm, inhaling her 
fruity perfume. The murmur of the guests had quieted down; they must have left 
for the reception hall. "I mean, they live for what, a few weeks? They mate, 
then they die. Mates for life."
