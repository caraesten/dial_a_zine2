We had gotten Badger the Bird in high school, shuttling him back and forth 
between our houses on a weekly basis. He had previously been the companion of an
elderly neighbor of mine, who had relinquished him when his care became too much
for her to handle. When he finally passed away, we buried his body in the 
forest, under a maple tree. A flock of crows, interested in our goings-on, had 
alighted in a nearby tree, cawing like a funerary choir, welcoming him home.

"Yeah," I said. "I don't know why. He had food and water, toys and a clean home.
What the hell more did he need?"

"Love?" She raised an eyebrow. "Maybe ours wasn't enough."

The little patch of sunlight coming through the stained glass window slowly 
lengthened as we swapped other remembrances - the days of my fashion dark age, 
when I would only wear pink and yellow; the time she forgot I had a brother, and
woke me up in a panic about the strange man on the sofa; the time when we sent 
our roommates on a scavenger hunt, which turned out to be a wild goose chase, 
just to have the day to ourselves.

"We'll still keep in touch," she said. It was neither a question, nor a 
statement of fact. Instead, it was a reality that she was trying to manifest 
into being.
