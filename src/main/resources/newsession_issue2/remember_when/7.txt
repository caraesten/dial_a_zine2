So instead, I told her, "We're more alike than you think, you know," hoping she 
would understand. Hoping she wouldn't.

She only gazed evenly at me in response. It felt like she was burrowing into my 
soul. I turned away, face delicately pink in the waning sunlight. Outside, the 
cicada cries had started to abate, but it only made those that remained seem to 
scream with still more urgency and keen desire: im hot for you i want to fuck 
you.

Her fingers brushed my cheek, but I did not turn back towards her. Then they 
grazed the inside of my thigh and my mind floated away from my body, as always. 
That's how I would be seen. I pushed myself away from her.

"Not here, not now."

She stopped, got to her feet and began brushing the dust off her dress, her 
pride clearly wounded, though I knew she would be too ashamed of the reaction to
admit it.
