Round Trip 


The astronomer at the switchboard. 
The channels alight like worms through
With peaches. You won't notice not 
A worm as it worms wings gibbous blue 
To opposable blue swatch, pocked pit
Umpire side agreement rotting niche hordes

On an accord pit an eye 

I take my cream before my coffee, burp grape 
Fruit sherbet. It's hot in the kitchen 
In mute space. Moons fall out 
Of pastry, moons funnel through za and where thumb
Met peach moon moonshadow widenedripening lye. 

Bent at the reflecterscope, uncountable finite dye
